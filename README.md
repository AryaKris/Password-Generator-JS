# Password-Generator-JS
An application to generate random passwords.
I created a repo in GitHub and since the application required to generate random passwords I used the repo name Password-Generator-JS. 
The first step was to create a pseudo code to help understand the application without the use of codes but to have an idea on how the application needs to work.
HTML and CSS files didn't need any changes. 
Javascript was updated as per the requirements of the projects and with reference to the pseudcode created.
